    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper ensemble
      (This config. should have been named hbase.zookeeper.ensemble).
      For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
      By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
      of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
      list of ZooKeeper ensemble servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
      this is the list of servers which hbase will start/stop ZooKeeper on as
      part of cluster start/stop. Client-side, we will take this list of
      ensemble members and put it together with the hbase.zookeeper.property.clientPort
      config. and pass it into zookeeper constructor as the connectString
      parameter.
